# Introduction:
This repo was created to help Amir in his c++ project.

# Instructions:

    - Linux
    - LibTorch
    - C++ / Java
    - CPU
    - Click on the **second link** - *"Download here (cxx11 ABI)"*
- Put the downloaded `.zip` file under your *~/Downloads* folder 
- Run on ~/Downloads - `unzip <filename>.zip`
- Run - `./build.sh` (if you get permission denied run `chmod +x build.sh`). Run it everytime you update the code.
- Run - `./run.sh` (if you get permission denied run `chmod +x run.sh`)
